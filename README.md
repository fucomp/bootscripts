# Bootscripts

Ever seen a cool command line echo in a sci-fi movie and thought "I wish my computer would do that"? Well now it can. I mean, it's not actually *doing* anything but it can *look* like it is.

This is a small selection of bash scripts for you to add to your profile so you can look like you R an 
31337 hacker from in the movies.

## Installation

Clone this repo into a folder named something like .scripts in your home folder and edit your .bash_profile file to use whichever file you want to see on start up.
